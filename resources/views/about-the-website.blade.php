            <h1> Website Project</h1>
            <h3> Motivation </h3>
                <p>
                    I've been interested in having a personal website for several years, but wanted to be able to develop and host the website myself. 
                    After the covid chip shortage, I was finally able to buy a raspberry pi, purchased a domain name, and started to develop this site. 
                    It has been a fun project, and made me even more interested in the power of data. 
                    I look forward to expanding this tool transitioning to a more powerful home server in the future.
