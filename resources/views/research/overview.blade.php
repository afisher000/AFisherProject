            <h1> Free Electron Lasers</h1>
            <h3> </h3>
            <p>
                Lasers are a powerful tool in science, but most of us only think about laser that we can see light green/red pen lasers. But as science 
                progresses towards trying to understand very small or very fast processes, it's necessary to have access to lasers at much shorter wavelengths.
                Power state-of-the-art lasers are made using the transition levels in atomic orbitals, but they are limited to wavelengths larger than a few hundred nanometers.
                
                Free Electron Lasers (FELs) can achieve much shorter wavelengths (current goals are sub-nanometer xrays) by using a different mechanism, 
                the interaction between a very fast electron beam and oscillating magnetic fields. Another advantage is that FELs can tune the wavelength of the light they produce.

            <h3> The Interaction </h3>
            <p>
                If a charge particle accelerates, it emits radiation (light) and losses a little bit of energy. Similar, a charge particle can absorb radiation and gain a little bit of energy. 
                The alternating magnetic field is designed to "wiggle" or "undulate"  the path of the electrons so they emit some radiation. But the radiation is very weak because the electrons are distributed
                uniformly along the electron beam, so there is strong destructive interference. The radiation interacts back on the wiggling electrons and if a certain resonance condition is met,
                some electrons will absorb energy from the radiation and some will give up energy and slow down. <b>Radiation</b> has created <b>energy modulation</b> in our beam. Now as the beam continues to propagate, the fast
                electrons catch up to the slow electrons and we start to see small bunches forming. <b>Energy modulation</b> has turned into a <b>density modulation</b>. Now the radiation emitted by the wiggling electrons is much stronger
                because they are no longer uniformly distributed. <b>Density modulation</b> leads to <b>stronger radiation</b>. This feedback loop between radiation, energy modulation, and density modulation leads to exponential growth
                in the radiation power making a very powerful laser!

            <h3> My Work </h3>
            <p>
                My research focuses on improving the efficiency of the FEL interaction and targeting THz frequencies where sources are scarce. Additionally, we use a waveguide to guide the radiation (limit the strong
                diffraction at )
                There are many aspects of work related to realizing FELs on an accelerator and fortunately UCLA is one of the few universities that has a particle accelerator on campus giving graduate students hands 
                on experience running a beamline, installing components, and troubleshooting hardware. Instead of targeting very short wavelengths, my research involves trying to
